# ðŸ“ŠAmazon Dataset Analysis Using Power BI  

## Project Overview  
This project involves analyzing a dataset containing ratings of the top 1,000 Amazon products. The goal was to clean, transform, and explore the data to extract valuable insights.  

## Key Tasks Performed  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: From Power Query, show column distribution (unique & distinct values). Column Quality (Valid, Empty, or Error values) â€¢ Column Profile (Statistics like min, max, and mean)
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**:Removed unnecessary columns, modified data types, Added new columns. 
- **DAX Measures & Calculations**: Applied DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create custom metrics.  
- **Data Visualization**: Built interactive dashboards using Power BI to present key insights.  

## Insights & Findings  
- Identified the **highest** and **lowest-rated** products.  
- Calculated **total revenue** from individual **categories and sub-categories**.  
- Displayed **important KPIs** to track performance.  
- Implemented **data filters** for better data exploration. 


## Tools Used  
- **Power BI** for data analysis and visualization.  
- **Power Query** for data cleaning and transformation.  
- **DAX** for advanced calculations and custom metrics.
